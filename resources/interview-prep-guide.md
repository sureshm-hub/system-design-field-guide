Approach to designing Systems (do Frequent Check in's/ collaboration checkpoints)
1) Ask clarifying questions and design outline of the system:
    - user journey
    - data flow
2) Identify NFR's:
    - cost
    - SLA
    - scalability
    - resilience
    - integration
    - brown field/green field
    - Technology Tie-In
    - DevOps, Testing
    - Stake Holder Inputs/Buy-In:
        - architects (standards/compliance)
        - end-users (experience, pain points)
        - product owners (business priorities)
    - Prioritization: CAP
3) Design the High Level
    - identify the core components
    - identify connections between them
    - discuss alternatives
    - Visualize the System Diagram
4) Low Level Design
    - API's
    - Table
    - Sequence Diagrams
4) E2E use case + Bottle Necks
5) Validate & Refine
