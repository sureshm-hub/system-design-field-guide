Shows interactions between the orchestration system, upstream event producers (e.g., microservices, batch jobs), and downstream consumers (e.g., analytics engines, dashboards).
and clarifies the system's scope and key dependencies.

## 1. Context Diagram

Showed interactions between the orchestration system, upstream event producers (e.g., microservices, batch jobs), and downstream consumers (e.g., analytics engines, dashboards).
Helped align stakeholders on the system's scope and key dependencies.


## 2. Component Diagram

Illustrated major system components such as the event router, workflow engine, state store, and message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS).
Captured API interfaces and interaction flows between components.

## 3. Sequence Diagram

Mapped out the lifecycle of an event from ingestion to processing and delivery.
Included event retries, error handling, and idempotency mechanisms.

## 4. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

Showed how data moved through the system, including transformations and enrichment at each stage.
Ensured data lineage was well understood, especially for compliance and observability.

## 5. Deployment Architecture

Designed how services and components would be deployed across cloud regions and availability zones.
Considered Kubernetes (GKP/GAP), containerized microservices, and serverless functions.

## 6. Failure Mode and Recovery Plan

Created a fault tolerance diagram showing failure scenarios and recovery strategies (e.g., circuit breakers, retries, dead-letter queues).
