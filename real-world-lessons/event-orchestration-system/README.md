Shows interactions between the orchestration system, upstream event producers (e.g., microservices, batch jobs), and downstream consumers (e.g., analytics engines, dashboards).
and clarifies the system's scope and key dependencies.

## 1. Context Diagram

Shows interactions between the orchestration system, upstream event producers (e.g., microservices, batch jobs), and downstream consumers (e.g., analytics engines, dashboards).
Helps align stakeholders on the system's scope and key dependencies.


## 2. Component Diagram

Illustrats major system components such as the event router, workflow engine, state store, and message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS).
Captures API interfaces and interaction flows between components.

## 3. Sequence Diagram

Mapps out the lifecycle of an event from ingestion to processing and delivery.
Includes event retries, error handling, and idempotency mechanisms.

## 4. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

Shows how data moved through the system, including transformations and enrichment at each stage.
Ensures data lineage was well understood, especially for compliance and observability.

## 5. Deployment Architecture

How services and components would be deployed across cloud regions and availability zones.
Considers Kubernetes (GKP/GAP), containerized microservices, and serverless functions.

## 6. Failure Mode and Recovery Plan

A fault tolerance diagram showing failure scenarios and recovery strategies (e.g., circuit breakers, retries, dead-letter queues).
