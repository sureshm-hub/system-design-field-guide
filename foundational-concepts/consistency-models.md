# Consistency Model Trade-offs

- Strong consistency provides accuracy but comes with latency, cost, and availability trade-offs. For many real-world apps (like social feeds), eventual or causal consistency is more efficient and acceptable.

- Eventual consistency still guarantees convergence across replicas over time. Itâ€™s predictable, just not immediate. It's ideal for high-availability systems where slight staleness is tolerable.

- Causal consistency is very practical in real-world systems like collaborative tools, messaging, and social apps, where operation order matters.

- You must choose trade-offs during partitions, not always. The system can be CA when no partitions exist. The CAP theorem only kicks in under network partitions.

- Many modern systems (like Cosmos DB, Cassandra, DynamoDB) support multiple consistency models, and let you tune per operation or per session.

- Consistency deals with visibility of data across replicas, not durability (persistence) or availability (uptime). They are separate guarantees in distributed systems.
